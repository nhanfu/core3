# ecommerce parity progress

Module owner: ecommerce module owner
QA assignment: dispatchable QA slot (wave assignment pending)
Status: qa-in-progress
Verification trigger: feature-complete
Candidate commit: 40aee3ed (DEV-4 Sales handoff outbox)

## Current state

The current wave has a committed Ecommerce implementation and authenticated
Core3 browser evidence. DEV-4 adds an eCommerce-owned, retry-safe outbox
contract for handing checkout orders to the separate Sales service. Functional
and ownership gates are still incomplete; no full parity claim is made here.

## DEV-4 evidence (2026-09-13)

- Isolated branch/worktree: `agent/odoo-ecommerce-dev4-sales-handoff`.
- Checkout creates exactly one `ecommerce_sales_handoffs` row per order,
  including authenticated and anonymous checkout paths.
- Sales-facing operations expose the handoff envelope and copied order lines.
- Claim/acknowledge mutations enforce attempt limits and optimistic row-version
  concurrency, including stale duplicate rejection.
- Sales now owns a polling consumer that claims the envelope, reads the declared
  order/line operations, imports source-linked Sales records, and acknowledges
  success or failure. The source link and line IDs make retries idempotent.
- Focused suite: `bun test ./test/ecommerce_sales_handoff_consumer.integration.test.ts ./test/ecommerce_checkout.integration.test.ts` —
  14 passed, 69 assertions, 0 failures.
- Remaining gates: authenticated actor/company matrix, external payment/delivery
  certification, paired Odoo comparison, and central review/merge.

## Review integration

- Integrated commit: `40aee3ed`.
- Reviewer reran `ecommerce_checkout.integration.test.ts`: 11 tests, 59
  assertions, 0 failures, and the repository UI audit passed.
- The Sales-side consumer, external provider certification, actor/company
  browser matrix, and paired Odoo gates remain open; this is not module
  sign-off.

## Next bounded task

Record the complete Odoo menu/action/view inventory, implement the module
functionality, and dispatch QA on the first committed candidate. Update this
file only with evidence from the matching module owner.
