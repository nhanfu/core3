# Inventory QA ledger

## Representative browser matrix (2026-09-12)

- Trigger: post-merge repository regression smoke.
- Coverage: one registered module route, authenticated Core3, desktop 1440x900 and mobile 390x844.
- Result: desktop and mobile render passed with no blank/redirect result, recorded page/request error, or horizontal overflow.
- Artifacts: /tmp/core3-odoo-parity/module-matrix-20260912/inventory-desktop.png and inventory-mobile.png.
- Boundary: this is route/render smoke evidence only; it does not sign off the complete menu tree, CRUD, permissions, workflows, persistence, or paired Odoo visual parity.

QA state: qa-in-progress
Trigger: feature-complete
Candidate commit: `HEAD` (`SettingsView mutation transport retest`)
Runtime: `http://127.0.0.1:3316`, isolated Inventory runner
Authenticated user: `admin@tms.local`

## Settings acceptance matrix

| ID | Check | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| INV-SET-01 | Manager-only menu, page/API `page.id`, SettingsView fields | PASS | `inventory_settings.integration.test.ts`; authenticated desktop/mobile render |
| INV-SET-02 | Deterministic settings defaults and idempotent migration | PASS | focused integration test, migration `0.0.17` |
| INV-SET-03 | Direct persisted update increments row version | PASS | authenticated `/api/mutate` response; repository mutation assertions |
| INV-SET-04 | Stale row version returns 409 | PASS | focused integration test |
| INV-SET-05 | Missing settings returns 404 | PASS | focused integration test |
| INV-SET-06 | Desktop render at 1440x900, no failed requests/errors/overflow | PASS | `/tmp/core3-inventory-settings-desktop.png`; Playwright state |
| INV-SET-07 | Mobile render at 390x844, no failed requests/errors/overflow | PASS | `/tmp/core3-inventory-settings-mobile.png`; Playwright state |
| INV-SET-08 | Authenticated Save click persists changed checkbox | PASS | Playwright POST `/api/mutate` includes `values`; Save succeeds and reload preserves the changed checkbox |
| INV-SET-09 | Odoo paired desktop/mobile visual comparison | BLOCKED | Odoo session unavailable in this run |

## Dispatch notes

The shared action transport retest passes for the Inventory Settings Save flow.
Keep the module open until the Odoo paired visual comparison and the remaining
Inventory route matrix are complete.
