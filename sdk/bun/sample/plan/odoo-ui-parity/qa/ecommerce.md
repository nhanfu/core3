# ecommerce QA ledger

## Representative browser matrix (2026-09-12)

- Trigger: post-merge repository regression smoke.
- Coverage: one registered module route, authenticated Core3, desktop 1440x900 and mobile 390x844.
- Result: desktop and mobile render passed with no blank/redirect result, recorded page/request error, or horizontal overflow.
- Artifacts: /tmp/core3-odoo-parity/module-matrix-20260912/ecommerce-desktop.png and ecommerce-mobile.png.
- Boundary: this is route/render smoke evidence only; it does not sign off the complete menu tree, CRUD, permissions, workflows, persistence, or paired Odoo visual parity.

QA state: qa-in-progress
QA slot: dispatchable ecommerce assignment (pending wave dispatch)
Module owner: ecommerce module owner
Verification trigger: feature-complete
Candidate commit: working tree after Ecommerce Categories slice

Current isolated runner inventory (4041): the manifest registers 8 routes;
 page/API contracts are present for all 9 manifest routes: Products, Pricelists,
 Pricelist detail, Categories, Orders list/detail, Unpaid Orders, Abandoned
 Carts, Customers, and Cart. Cart has persisted summary/line contracts; Shop
 and checkout remain unimplemented journeys.

Detailed execution matrix: [`test-plans/ecommerce.md`](test-plans/ecommerce.md). It is the module-level source for catalog, pricelists, commerce workflows, actors, persistence, Temporal, and paired Odoo gates.

## Test-case inventory

| Test ID | Scenario | Evidence | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ECOMMERCE-PENDING-001 | Complete module functionality, permissions, persistence, and desktop/mobile authenticated browser matrix | No current-wave candidate has been submitted | pending |
| ECOMMERCE-FUNC-002 | Categories page/API, deterministic data and permissioned CRUD contracts | `bun test ./test/ecommerce*.integration.test.ts` — 6 tests, 43 assertions | pass |
| ECOMMERCE-FUNC-003 | Orders list/API, deterministic search/status/empty contracts | `bun test ./test/ecommerce_orders.integration.test.ts` — 2 tests, 8 assertions | pass |
| ECOMMERCE-FUNC-004 | Order detail form/API, persisted read and not-found contract | Same focused Orders test — 2 tests, 13 assertions | pass |
| ECOMMERCE-FUNC-005 | Unpaid Orders list/API and unpaid-state filter | `bun test ./test/ecommerce_unpaid_orders.integration.test.ts` — 2 tests, 8 assertions | pass |
| ECOMMERCE-FUNC-006 | Abandoned Carts list/API and deterministic read boundary | `bun test ./test/ecommerce_abandoned_carts.integration.test.ts` — 2 tests, 9 assertions | pass |
| ECOMMERCE-FUNC-007 | Customers list/API, summary data and order navigation | `bun test ./test/ecommerce_customers.integration.test.ts` — 2 tests, 8 assertions | pass |
| ECOMMERCE-FUNC-008 | Cart summary/lines, totals, navigation and quantity guard | `bun test ./test/ecommerce_cart.integration.test.ts` — 2 tests, 7 assertions | pass |
| ECOMMERCE-SCOPE-001 | Manifest-to-page/API coverage | Current implementation covers all 8 registered Ecommerce routes; shop/cart/checkout journey and mutations remain unimplemented | pass for route coverage; journey pending |
