# Timesheets detailed QA test plan

Module: timesheets  
QA owner: timesheets-qa  
Developer owner: timesheets module owner  
Reference addon/version: hr_timesheet, Odoo 19 Community  
Plan status: approved  
Last reviewed: 2026-09-12

This plan follows [`timesheets.md`](../../timesheets.md); executed evidence is
recorded in [`../timesheets.md`](../timesheets.md).

## Coverage inventory

| Menu/action family | Core3 route families | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Personal/all timesheets | personal, all, employee, detail and settings routes | Entry CRUD, scopes, approval, task/project links and settings |
| Reporting | analysis/report routes | Graph/pivot/list, date/project/employee filters and read-only data |
| Embedded integrations | Project task Timesheets tab and approval action | Project-owned hours mutation, relation loading and permission boundaries |

Actors are Timesheets Manager, employee, project manager, Fleet ordinary user,
wrong-company user and unauthenticated user. Fixtures use stable employees,
projects, tasks, timesheet entries, approvals and report rows; mutations use
isolated databases and deterministic dates.

## Functional, workflow, security, and visual gates

| Case ID | Expected result | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TIMESHEET-FUNC-001 | Personal/all/employee CRUD, scoped actions, settings and embedded-task contracts use persisted data | pass: focused suite |
| TIMESHEET-FUNC-002 | Analysis renders Graph/Pivot/List with declared fields, filters, empty and transport states | pass: fixed contract and authenticated retest |
| TIMESHEET-WF-001 | Draft → Submitted → Approved updates versions and dispatches Project-owned hours with row-derived inputs | pass: authenticated probe |
| TIMESHEET-FUNC-003 | Create → edit → delete persists; stale/post-delete actions are denied without partial writes | pass: authenticated CRUD probe |
| TIMESHEET-PERM-001 | Manager/employee boundaries succeed; Fleet receives expected 403 for read/manage/settings/approval; cross-company data is isolated | partial: Fleet boundary verified |
| TIMESHEET-DATA-001 | Reapply schema/demo data idempotently; reload/restart preserves entries, approvals and linked hours | reload pass; restart planned |
| TIMESHEET-UI-001 | All 13 routes render at 1440x900 and 390x844 without errors or overflow | route 26/26 pass |
| TIMESHEET-UI-002 | My/All/By Employee, task tab, forms and reports match paired Odoo states | 12 representative captures pass; remaining states planned |
| TIMESHEET-INT-001 | Project, payroll, calendar, notification and other durable integrations use Temporal with retry/replay/restart/compensation coverage | planned |

## Exit criteria

Full sign-off requires complete route/action CRUD, all actor and company
boundaries, restart persistence, remaining embedded/report interactions, and
paired Odoo desktop/mobile comparisons. Current evidence is conditional.
