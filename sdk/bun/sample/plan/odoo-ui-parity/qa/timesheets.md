# timesheets QA ledger

## Representative browser matrix (2026-09-12)

- Trigger: post-merge repository regression smoke.
- Coverage: one registered module route, authenticated Core3, desktop 1440x900 and mobile 390x844.
- Result: desktop and mobile render passed with no blank/redirect result, recorded page/request error, or horizontal overflow.
- Artifacts: /tmp/core3-odoo-parity/module-matrix-20260912/timesheets-desktop.png and timesheets-mobile.png.
- Boundary: this is route/render smoke evidence only; it does not sign off the complete menu tree, CRUD, permissions, workflows, persistence, or paired Odoo visual parity.

QA state: dormant
QA slot: dispatchable timesheets assignment (pending wave dispatch)
Module owner: timesheets module owner
Verification trigger: feature-complete
Candidate commit: none
